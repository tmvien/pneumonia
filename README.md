X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation. Because X-rays can pass through most objects, they are used to create images of the inside of your body. 
X rays are useful with potential findings and diagnosis of diseases including Lung infections. Evidence of pneumonia, or lung cancer can show up on chest X-rays. 
Generally, radiation exposure can cause cell mutations that may lead to cancer. However, radiation exposure from an X-ray is low, 
and the benefits from these tests far outweigh the risks.
